It is an agent running on each node
It looks for new Services created in the cluster and updates the IP table rules on 
each node to forward the traffic recieved on the IP that is assigned to the SERVICE to the Backend application/DB POD IP

ex: a clusterIP service named DB is created and it gets an IP add. 10.13.25.09
    PODs grouped for this service is running in Node A with IP 100.23.45.67 & also on Node B at 100.24.45.67
    On the Nodes IP table is updated by kube-proxy

   Node A IP TABLE
   10.13.25.09  100.23.45.67

   Node B IP TABLE
   10.13.25.09  100.24.45.67
