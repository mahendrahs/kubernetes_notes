kubernetes service
Its a method of exposing the application running in multiple pods to a single interface
It provides a single URL for access for the application running behind it

1. NodePort     - Externally made available, spans across Nodes
2. ClusterIP    - Internally exposed 
3. LoadBalancer - Externaly made availbale. Cloud Platform Providers

=====

In Kubernetes, a "ClusterIP" service is used for internal communication within the cluster,
 meaning it only allows access from other pods inside the cluster
 
 while a "NodePort" service exposes your application to external clients by assigning a 
 specific port on each node in the cluster, allowing access from outside the cluster as well; 
 
 essentially, ClusterIP is for internal traffic and NodePort is for external traffic


 =========

kind: Service
type: LoadBalancer

A "LoadBalancer type Service" in Kubernetes is a service configuration that leverages the
 underlying cloud provider to automatically provision and manage an external load balancer,
  effectively distributing incoming traffic across multiple pods within a Kubernetes cluster, 
  providing external access to your application and ensuring high availability by evenly 
  distributing requests among available instances; essentially, it acts as a traffic manager
   that directs incoming connections to the most suitable pod based on load balancing strategies.

spec:
  type: NodePort / ClusterIP / LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
    - nodePort: 80
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
